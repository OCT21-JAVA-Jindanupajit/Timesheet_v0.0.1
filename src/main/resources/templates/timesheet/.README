Filenames changed!

timesheetform -> timesheet_form

listtimesheet -> timesheet_list

We need:

timesheet_detail - View detail of single timesheet


Note

This line
<!--/*@thymesVar id="jediEntity" type="java.util.List<jbc.timesheet.model.Timesheet>"*/-->

will tell thymeleaf that jediEntity is a List of Timesheet

This line
<!--/*@thymesVar id="jediEntity" type="jbc.timesheet.model.Timesheet"*/-->

will tell thymeleaf that jediEntity is Timesheet

It will get rid of the red underline and make your life easier, do not delete. KEEP it!


'jediAction' will tell you where to submit the form
